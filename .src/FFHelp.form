The default at startup is to show all your home directory files except the hidden files which is why there are more logged files than files that match the search.\n\nTo locate your files enter a search string in the left hand textbox (e.g.  documents ) and click \"Search\" or press the [Enter] key. To search within the data entered in the previous instruction enter text in right hand textbox (e.g.  .odt )  and click \"Search\" or press the [Enter] key. You can, of course, fill both boxes before starting the search, do not use wild cards.\n\nThe search will show up to the first 10 files. You can use the mouse wheel or the scroll bar to show more files. [Page up] and [Page down] can also be used. Pressing [Alt] will highlight the othert shortcut keys (e.g. [Alt] + h will show/hide hidden files)\n\nIf the \"Case sensitive\"  checkbox is unchecked files named with either case will be found. e.g. \"DelEtE\" will find \"Delete\". If the option is selected case will be sensitive.\n\nTo search for hidden files check the \"Show hidden files\" checkbox. \n\nTo search system files check \"Show system files\" checkbox. This will also show other mounted drives e.g. a USB stick or a CD (You will need to click \"Update\" if the media is inserted after FindFiles has been opened, see \"Update\" below). If you need to see every file on your system you will need to run this program with sudo or from a root prompt (AT YOUR OWN RISK).\n\nThe \"Database update\" button will upload the latest database, this is created in the background. You may need to do this TWICE to see very recent changes, make a note of the times and dates of updates shown in the \"Tooltips\" while the mouse hovers over the \"Database update\" button.\n\nYou can double click on a file to open it. Not all files will open, but if your system is aware of the file type it should work, clicking on a directory will open your file manager.\n\nThe properties on the file will be displayed if the mouse is held over the file name. \n\nRight clicking on a file or directory will give you the option to open either the file manager or terminal in the directory the file resides.\n\nLogging times can vary dramatically. The first time might take over 60 seconds. \n\nThe program will remember the checkbox settings between sessions. \n\nTo completely remove the program you will need to also delete ~/.FFdatabase directory and the file ~/.config/gambas3/FindFiles.conf\n\nFindFiles is written in Gambas\nSpecial thanks to the forum users at whiteislandsoftware.com for their help in creating better code.\nFindfiles icon by Everaldo Coelho found at www.iconfinder.com\n\nCopyright (C) 2013 & 2014 & 2015 Charlie Ogier (bugs@cogier.com)\nThis program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.\nThis program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
